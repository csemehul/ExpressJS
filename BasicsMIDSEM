Scalability: Express JS is designed to be lightweight and scalable, which makes it suitable for building both small projects and large-scale applications. It is asynchronous and has event-driven architecture which allows you to handle a large number of requests.

Active Community Support: Express JS has a large active community who contribute to its growth and improvement. Because of them the framework is regularly updated and well-documented.

Features of Express JS
Fast Server-Side Development 
The features of node js help express saving a lot of time.

Routing 
It refers to how an application's endpoint's URLs respond to client requests.

Templating
